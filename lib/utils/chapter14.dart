  "I shall now declare unto thee again that supreme wisdom, the best of all knowledge, knowing which all the sages have attained to supreme perfection after this life.",
  "Taking refuge in this knowledge of Mine, those who have attained My nature are not reborn even during creation, nor do they suffer during dissolution.",
  "My womb is the great Brahman (the ultimate reality), and in that I place the germ (of all beings). From that, O Arjuna, comes the birth of all beings.",
  "Whatever forms are born from all the different kinds of wombs, O Arjuna, the great Brahman is their womb and I am the seed-giving father.",
  "The three qualities - sattva (goodness), rajas (passion), and tamas (ignorance) - born of nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, bind fast the immutable embodied soul in the body.",
  "Of these, the mode of goodness, which is pure, illuminating and free from disease, binds the soul by creating attachment to happiness and knowledge, O sinless one.",
  "Know that the mode of passion is characterized by desire and attachment to fruitive work, O Arjuna. It binds the embodied soul to material objects by means of attachment to the results of activities.",
  "O Arjuna, know that ignorance-born tamas produces delusion for all embodied beings. It binds them with the ropes of negligence, indolence and sleep.",
  "O Arjuna, sattva binds one to happiness, rajas to action, while tamas, covering knowledge, binds one to delusion in negligence.",
  "O Arjuna, by predominance of rajas, tamas, or sattva, the qualities of those modes are generated. The nature of sattva arises from predominance over rajas and tamas, rajas arises from predominance over sattva and tamas, and tamas arises from predominance over sattva and rajas.",
  "When the light of knowledge illuminates all the gates of the body, then it is said that the person has attained a state of purity and goodness (sattva).",
  "Desire, activity, and restlessness arise when Rajas is dominant, O Arjuna. These qualities cause a person to be attached to action, result in excessive striving, and are the source of craving.",
  "Increased tamas (darkness) gives rise to qualities such as lack of illumination, inactivity, negligence, and delusion, O Arjuna!",
  "When the embodied being passes beyond the three modes of material nature (goodness, passion, and ignorance) which are the source of the body, he attains to the pure transcendental knowledge and reaches the stage of supreme peace, in which the soul attains everlasting happiness.",
  "When one perishes in Rajas, the cause of activity, the world of the active is born; in the same way, when one perishes in Tamas, the deluded darkness is born in the world.",
  "They say that the fruit of good action is pure and consists of sattva, while the fruit of action born of rajas is pain and the fruit of action born of tamas is ignorance.",
  "From purity arises knowledge, from passion arises greed, from negligence and delusion arises darkness (ignorance).",
  "Those situated in the mode of goodness gradually go upward to the higher planets; those in the mode of passion live on the earthly planets; and those in the mode of ignorance go down to the hellish worlds.",
  "When the seer beholds no agent other than the Gunas [qualities], and knows That which is higher than the Gunas, he attains to My Being.",
  "Having transcended these three modes of material nature, the embodied being who has been freed from birth, death, and old age, attains the nectar of immortality.",
  "Arjuna said, \"O Lord, by what signs is one who has transcended these three modes known? What is their conduct and how do they transcend these three modes?\"",
  "O Arjuna, he who remains undisturbed in all circumstances, and is neither excited by sense pleasures nor gets perturbed by difficulties, he is eligible for attaining eternal knowledge.",
  "One who remains uninvolved and neutral, unaffected by the qualities (gunas), and knows that the qualities alone are interacting with each other, stays steady and does not falter.",
  "He who is equipoised in happiness and distress, and is established in the self, who is the same in pleasure and pain, and who looks upon a clod, a stone and gold as of equal value, who is equal towards a dear and an enemy, and who is equipoised in honour and dishonour, is said to be in the mode of goodness.",
  "One who is equal in honor and dishonor, equipoised toward friend and foe, and renounces all fruitive activities, such a person is said to have transcended the modes of material nature.",
  "And he who serves Me with unswerving devotion, surpassing the three modes of material nature, and is thus free from their influence, becomes fit to attain union with the Absolute",
  "For I am the foundation of Brahman, the immortal and imperishable, of eternal dharma and of absolute bliss.",
